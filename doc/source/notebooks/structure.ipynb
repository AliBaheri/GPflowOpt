    "In Bayesian Optimization, the typical assumption is that $f$ is expensive to evaluate and no gradients are available. The typical approach is to sequentially select a limited set of decisions $\\boldsymbol{x}_0, \\boldsymbol{x}_1, ... \\boldsymbol{x}_{n-1}$ using a sampling policy. Hence each decision $\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$ itself is the result of an optimization problem\n",

    "Each iteration, a function $\\alpha_i$ which is cheap-to-evaluate acts as a surrogate for the expensive function. It is typically a mapping of the predictive distribution of a (Bayesian) model built on all decisions and their corresponding (noisy) evaluations. The mapping introduces an order in $\\mathcal{X}$ to obtain a certain goal. The typical goal within the context of Bayesian Optimization is the search for *optimality* or *feasibility* while keeping the amount of required evaluations ($n$) a small number. As we can have several functions $f$ representing objectives and constraints, Bayesian Optimization may invoke several models and mappings $\\alpha$. These mappings are typically referred to as *acquisition functions* (or *infill criteria*). GPflowOpt defines an `Acquisition` interface to implement these mappings and provides implementations of some default choices. In combination with a special `Optimizer` implementation for Bayesian Optimization, following steps are required for a typical workflow: \n",

    "1) Define the **problem domain**. Its dimensionality matches the input to the objective and constraint functions. (like normal optimization)\n",
